# Outfit Recommender System 👕👗

     The Outfit Recommender System is a machine learning–driven project that provides personalized fashion suggestions based on user preferences. By recording swipe interactions (like, dislike, save), the system learns user behavior and generates tailored outfit recommendations.

# What is it? 🎯

    The project recommends outfits by analyzing user swipe patterns. Each interaction is used to refine the recommendation model, ensuring suggestions become more accurate and relevant over time.


# My Contribution 👩‍💻

     I developed the machine learning recommender system that powers the project:
	•	Designed and implemented the recommendation algorithm using PyTorch, pandas, and numpy.
	•	Processed and cleaned product datasets (CSV files) for training and prediction.
	•	Built a Flask backend API to serve recommendations in real time.
	•	Optimized the model for scalability and efficient handling of large data.


# Challenges 🥺
	•	Developing an algorithm that adapts to diverse and evolving user preferences.
	•	Managing performance issues when working with large image and interaction datasets.
	•	Ensuring smooth backend–frontend integration for real-time recommendations.
